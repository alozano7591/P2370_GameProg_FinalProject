## Project Overview

This is a game that I created using the MonoGame framework in c#. This game is the result of my final assignment
for my third semester course Programming Game Structures. The programming was done completely by myself, while 
I had some help with art assets.

## What is the game about?

This game is a "Legend Of Zelda" (NES version) meets "Call Of Duty" creation. It is created in a top down 2D view,
while having a WW2 inspired scene. The player travels through the world collecting guns, picking up items, and deafeating
the enemy invaders. 

## Instructions for how to develop, use, and test the code.

* **To Run just download Visual studio 2022 (will not work in 2019), build, and then run. 
* **MonoGame Plugins for Visual Studio may be required, but do come with the project itself. I haven't tested running it on visual studio without the monogame framework installed.
